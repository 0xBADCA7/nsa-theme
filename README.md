# NSA theme
This is a very simple but effective (yes, see *Impact*) MDM desktop manager HTML theme that mimics an imaginative login screen of NSA machines (as seen in movies). It works only with the MDM desktop manager for Linux and has almost no controls for switcthing users, sessions, etc. - bare screen with a credentials prompt.

# Installation
* Download the theme by switching to the "release" branch of this repository or clone the "master" branch and make a zip archive out of this folder.

* First off you need to have [MDM](https://github.com/linuxmint/mdm) display manager installed. There are multiple ways of doing it, however if you're running Mint Linux, most likely you already have it installed.

* After having MDM installed you need to go to *Login Window Preferences* applet or call `mdmsetup` (perhaps, via `sudo`) from your terminal. This will get you to the themes window where you can select the NSA theme archive on your disk by clicking the plus "+" icon in the top right corner.

* Select the newly installed theme in the list (i.e. make it active). Log out and enjoy.


# Impact
Having this theme installed may prompt/cause:

* your coworkers and peers to shoulder-surf you

* true NSA employees devote more attention to you

* DefCon and BlackHat attendees to take you for an NSA employee by mistake

* waiters at your local cafe in Shanghai spill coffee on your table or saucer more frequently

* other signs of curiosity


# External media
The main font is Roboto. Roboto fonts are freely available online and can be downloaded from [Google Developer](https://developer.android.com/design/style/typography.html). Make sure you dowload Roboto Condensed and install it on your system. Pragmata Pro font is equally suggested to be installed, although it's a paid one.
